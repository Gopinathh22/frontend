We are both adventurous, outgoing and always open to a new experience or challenge. We think outside the box, or in the case of microgreens, outside of the tray.

At the pitching contest in May 2023, Verdes achieved a top 3 position and we won admittance to a Summer Boot Camp about entrepreneurship, where we continued our learning journey. These experiences showed that seasoned professionals see potential in the business, and they motivated us to continue and follow this path. So, here we are, two students trying to participate in the revolution towards, healthier, more sustainable diets, all the while tending the relationships we form along the way with the same care we tend to our young plants with.",
